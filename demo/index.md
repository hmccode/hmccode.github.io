## Marriott Southbeach Awesome

- The app name can be changed! We are using Southbeach Awesome for demo purposes. 
- This is work in progress! Not all pages are working....in fact, hotel detail, outlet detail, voucher detail, settings and contact US are all not working right now.
- This app works in two modes:
	- Brochure ware mode: allows potential members to browse through the hotels, outlets, offers and benefits.
	- Membership mode: unlocks full potential of the app including eCerts and discount codes.
- The home page does not have the physical card! It does display brief membership info. The card is available in the `My Account` page. 
- The discount code is available in the menu and also in the `My Account` page. 
- Everything else matches the current apps.
- There is an important feature demoed here which is to allow members to invite other members. Currently that form is available inside the `My Account` page. But it can be surfaced up if need be. Also...if running in a real device, the app will show the contacts available in the app which allows members to select friends to send invitations to.
