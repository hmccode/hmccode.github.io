## Marriott South Beach Elite

- The app name can be changed! We are using `South Beach Elite` for demo purposes. 
- This is work in progress! Not all pages are working....in fact, hotel detail, outlet detail, voucher detail, settings and contact US are all not working right now.
- This app works in three modes:
	- Brochure-ware mode: allows potential members to browse through the hotels, outlets, offers and benefits. They may request to join by filling out a form. Eventually we can make it go directly to the companion site to purchase online.
	- Membership mode: unlocks full potential of the app including eCerts and discount codes.
	- Invitee mode: partial features unlocked via a special invitee code. Please see below. 
- The home page does not have the physical card! It does display brief membership info. The card is available in the `My Account` page. 
- The discount code is available in the menu as `Avail Discount` and also in the `My Account` page. 
- The `member makes member` feature will allow members to invite other members. Currently that form is available inside the `My Account` page. But it can be surfaced up if need be. Also...if running in a real device, the app will show the contacts available in the app which allows members to select friends to send invitations to.
- Unfortunately we cannot yet demo the invitee mode in the app! But the app will have some sort of watermark to indicate an `invitee` mode. In this mode, it will allow only 2-3 discount codes be revealed and the membership will expire in a week. 
- The `Program Performance Report` shown on this site is also work in progress. We are working to make this much better. But the main idea is that we are bringing all the data related to program performance in this report.
- Please note that `Program Performance Report` actually has 6 pages! So make sure you navigate through them all by clicking the page indicator at the bottom of the report and select `CircleM` to have meaningful data.
