title: About HMC Docs
---
<p>
  We started this project to make sure that HMC has up-to-date documentation for all of its products. The product documentation revolves around 3 main categories:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>Developer Notes</li>
  <li>IT Manager Notes</li>
  <li>Business Rules</li>
</ul>

<p>
  In addition there will be a how-to section organized as posts or articles to produce something close to a knowledge base base.
</p>

<p>
  This asset lives as a collection of documentation repositories in GitHub under an organization called HMCDOCS. This site is the public face for this organization and it has four sections:
</p>

<ul>
  <li>ABOUT which is this page</li>
  <li>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/">POSTS</a>
    which is a collection of public posts and articles about documentation and other HMC topics that can be shared with the rest of the world</li>
    <li>
      <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/repos">REPOS</a>
      which lists all the repositories and a descrition for each. Access requires authentication.</li>
  <li>
    <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/insights">INSIGHTS</a>
    which is a charts to show some analytics about our doc repositories and how they are being used</li>
</ul>
