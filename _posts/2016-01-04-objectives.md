Would you believe it is already 2016? For us at HMC Software Development and Data Analysis, we are planning several  changes to our team structure and to our focus.

* [Team Restructring](#team-restructuring)
* [Key Products](#key-products)
* [Key Technologies](#key-technologies)
* [Key Activities](#key-activities)

## Team Restructring

Due to today's business demands, we need to deliver fater and better. This is not specific to HMC ...but it is an industry-wide problem that must be solved by IT. At HMC, however and due to resource constraints, we are feeling pain mostly in the following two areas:

* [Poor Resource Scaling](#poor-resource-scaling)
* [No Maintenance Team](#no-maintenance-team)  

The motivation of the restrutring is to attempt to fix the above two pain points. Before I propose a solution, let me first define what the above two problems actually mean.

In order to delve into that, let us list the tasks that go in building a product.

1. Technology Choice
2. Design & Architecture
3. Infrastrure Work
4. Coding & Testing
5. Documentation
6. Release & Deployment
7. Product Maintenance

Steps 4, 5 and 6 happen iteratively until the product is initially released.

*ADD PICTURE*

To handle the tasks above, there are two types of developes involved:

* Architects
* Maintainers

Here is how the above tasks are split among architects and maintainers:

*ADD PICTURE*

We often experience slow down in our product development process because the architects are often involved in nitty gritty tasks that should not be handled by them. Instead these tasks must be delegated to a maintenance team that can inherit the product development from the main architects and provide ongoing innovations, fixes and enhancements.      

Going back to the pain points mentioned above:

#### Poor Resource Scaling

Scaling is the ability to respond in an expected & (more or less) constant speed to business demands. When the architects are involved in non-core tasks, the speed at which we respond to business demand shoots up exponentially causing our development cycle to become unexpectable.

#### No Maintenance Team

Right now, architects are involved in the product development and maintenance. This hugely strains the architects and forces them to juggle many tasks at the time. The end result is fatigue and frustration. In addition, many issues rise after the product has been deployed and running for a while. When architects receive support issues, they almost have to re-learn what they have done to apply fixes which is a very frustrating experience especially when architects are busy developing/architecting new products.   

The solution then becomes obvious!! If we split our team between architecture and maintenance, things will work much better. This will allow us to scale better, provide better product maintenance and plan our technology stack better.   

_Splitting, however, does not mean that we have hard boundaries that our team members will not cross. In fact, given our team size and diversity, most likely each one of us will have to wear multiple hats in different products._

The purpose of the split therefore is to realize the picture above and make our team operate as architects and maintainers. In addition splitting allows us to add resources in the right team when we see a need. Generally speaking, adding maintainers is much cheaper than adding architects. Given our current resources, the team might look like this:

## Key Products

* [Insights](#insights)
* [Promotions and Push Notifications](#promotions-and-push-notifications)  
* [Cloud Workflows](#cloud-workflows)  
* [Renewals and Ecommerce](#renewals-and-ecommerce)  
* [Mobile Apps](#mobile-apps)  

#### Insights

[https://hmcinsights.com](https://hmcinsights.com) will receive much needed attention. This is where we plan to aggregate all our reports for internal use. The site will be divided into two parts:

1. Listing Reports
2. Glaneable Reports i.e. Dashboards

The idea is to collect all the reports that were requested by marketinng and finance and place them in one place for easy reference. In addition, the site will contain analytics reports that will be displayed as dashboards for different products such mobile apps, emcommerce, etc.

The ability to provide access to external users may not be in scope for [https://hmcinsights.com](https://hmcinsights.com).

#### Promotions and Push Notifications

We will continue to enhance [https://hmcoffers.com](https://hmcoffers.com) to provide better analytics and ease of use. One the major things we might attempt is to make this platform the main offers platform for HMC. In other words, port the current Mosaic vouchers functionality into it.
