This document serves as a quick guide to get you started with Github. Before we proceed, it is assumed that you have already created an account in github.com and your userid has already received an invitation to access the mosaic repository or any of HMC repositories.

##### Step 1
Download and install Github for windows using the link below.
https://desktop.github.com/

##### Step 2
After the installation has been completed, launch the Github application.

##### Step 3
Open your browser and head over to the repository you want to clone in your desktop. In this example we will be cloning the HMC Mosaic repository. https://github.com/hmcdocs/mosaic

##### Step 4
Start cloning the mosaic repository.

##### Step 5
A login screen will popup in Github application asking for your login details.

##### Step 6
After a successful login, a new popup window will show "BROWSE FOR FOLDER". This will be the path in your local drive where it copies the entire repository from github and creates a host as your local copy. Once cloning in completed, you should be able to see the mosaic repository in your github application (highlighted in blue).

> NOTE:
> The github application only acts as a source control between github.com server and your local github replica. The github tool is only used to track down local changes so be sure to always check-in/commit your changes to the server and also sync the whole repository to get the updated files before you modify an existing document.

## Creating/Modiying Articles

There are so many ways to edit the HMC Knowledge Base articles and you are free to use any text editor tool where you find comfortable working with. You can either edit it in notepad, notepad++ or programmers notepad but since we are usually using github flavoured markdown I suggest using the ATOM text editor (https://atom.io/). Atom text editor is free, fast and easy to use. There is also a nice MD editor called [Haroopress](http://pad.haroopress.com/) discovered by Gibin.
